# Enterprise-Network-Implementation-

# Project Description

This repository contains comprehensive documentation and configuration files for an enterprise network implementation project for the ENSA Company. The project demonstrates hands-on expertise in configuring and troubleshooting Cisco routers, switches, and various network services and protocols to support IPv4, IPv6, and wireless connectivity within an enterprise environment.

# Key Features and Configurations

* Routers and Switches Configuration
  * Deployed and configured Cisco 4331 routers and various switches to establish the network infrastructure.
  * Configured hostnames, banners, and essential management protocols across all devices.

# IPv4 and IPv6 Network Configuration

* Implemented IPv4 and IPv6 addressing schemes, ensuring proper connectivity and route advertisement.
* Configured static routes and dynamic routing using OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.

# VLAN and Trunking

* Set up VLANs for segmentation, assigned access ports, and configured trunk links between switches.
* Configured Switched Virtual Interfaces (SVIs) for inter-VLAN routing.

# Wireless Network Implementation

* Configured wireless LAN controllers, access points, and associated security protocols.
* Implemented WPA/WPA2 security standards for the wireless network, enhancing networksecurity.

# Security Configurations

* Applied Access Control Lists (ACLs) and firewall rules to secure network access.
* Configured NAT on routers to facilitate private-to-public IP address translation.

# Advanced Network Services

* Configured DHCP services for dynamic host addressing.
* Implemented GRE tunnels, DNS services, and SYSLOG for enhanced network operation and logging.

# Skills Demonstrated

* Proficiency in Cisco IOS configuration and troubleshooting.
  * Application of network protocols and services, such as OSPF, DHCP, and DNS.
  * Implementation of network security practices, including ACLs and firewall configurations.
  * Configuration of wireless networks, including security settings and access point associations.

# Conclusion

This project represents a practical application of network engineering principles, demonstrating the ability to design, configure, and secure a multifaceted enterprise network infrastructure. It showcases proficiency in a multitude of networking technologies, protocols, and Cisco devices, culminating in a robust and secure network implementation.
